News App
i made news app using 2 pattern:
1. main branch using swiftUI and MVVM Pattern
2. VIPER branch using UIKit and VIPER Pattern(i only made news home as requested)

note: Swiftâ€™s protocols are a way of letting us define functionality and optionally provide default implementations where needed. They are a fundamental feature of the language, allowing us enforce requirements in types, create unit test mocks, share functionality easily, and more.
